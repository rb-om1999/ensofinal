The strategy is to enter a long position upon confirmation that the price is holding above the 9-EMA (approx. 4,072). The bullish MACD crossover serves as the primary entry trigger. Given the opposing fundamental pressure, the position size should be reduced. Exit the trade immediately at the take profit (4,089.00) or stop loss (4,067.00) level without hesitation, as the bearish macro trend could resume quickly."

      "summary": "The technical analysis of the 15-minute chart reveals a bullish consolidation pattern as LTCUSDT presses against its 200-period moving average resistance. This potential breakout setup is supported by positive fundamental news regarding a new Litecoin partnership, creating a synergistic bullish case. The proposed trade is to buy on a confirmed breakout above the consolidation zone, targeting a previous structural resistance level at $94.00, which offers a favorable 2:1 risk-to-reward ratio.",
      "customStrategy": "This trade is designed for a 'squeeze-momentum' style. The primary entry trigger is a 15-minute candle closing decisively above the key resistance at ~$91.11. The entry price of $91.60 is a confirmation level to avoid false breakouts. Upon entry, confirm that the MACD histogram remains positive to validate momentum. Given the Medium confidence, a position size representing 1% of account equity is advised. If the price reaches $92.80 (50% to TP), move the stop loss to the entry price to create a risk-free trade."

Place a limit sell order within this zone, targeting an entry around \u20b9172.50.

If the price breaks out and moves towards the 2.455 target, watch for bearish divergence (price makes a new high, but RSI makes a lower high) as a signal to secure profits. Conversely, if the breakout fails and the price retests the 2.25-2.30 support area, look for bullish divergence (price makes a lower low, but RSI makes a higher low) to form, which would present an alternative long entry with strong confirmation."
